Educating the community one at a time was fulfilling, yet too much time was invested on those who really donâ€™t have the right knowledge or drive to stop consuming city tap water and big business bottled water.`,

//     p2: `What we have developed here was a simple online platform that produces solutions based off each individuals needs. The goal was to take countless hours of live demonstrations, peer reviewed articles, state water testing results and give you the most comprehensive analysis about the state of our water. `,
    
//     p3: `If you believe quarterly water reports that are tested from the water treatment plant are safe and under the federal guidelines, then this information is not for you. If you realize that your water flows from eroding underground pipes, that are 20 to 100 years old and miles away from your plant and that water is never tested by your municipality at your location, then our life changing solutions are just for you.  `,
