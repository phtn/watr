description: "Wallace Water is the creation from years of research and testing water quality for homeowners, family, and friends to help them make an educated decision on what's worthwhile to purchase for their household needs. Educating the community one at a time was fulfilling, yet too much time was invested on those who really don’t have the right knowledge or drive to stop consuming city tap water and big business bottled water."

Do you know what blogs are? If you don’t, then you’ve come to the right place. In the beginning, a blog was more of a personal diary that people shared online, and it goes back to 1994. In this online journal, you could talk about your daily life or share things you do. But, people saw an opportunity to communicate any information in a new way. So began the beautiful world of blogging.
