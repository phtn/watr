description: "Wallace Water is the creation from years of research and testing water quality for homeowners, family, and friends to help them make an educated decision on what's worthwhile to purchase for their household needs. Educating the community one at a time was fulfilling, yet too much time was invested on those who really donâ€™t have the right knowledge or drive to stop consuming city tap water and big business bottled water."
